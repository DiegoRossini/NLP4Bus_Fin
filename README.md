# **Natural Language Processing for Business and Finance at USI**  

## **Course Overview**  

### **Topics Covered:**  
- Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Introduction to Machine Learning  
- Overview of NLP applications most relevant to business and finance  

### **Objectives**  
In recent years, thanks to the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the automatic analysis and generation of **unstructured textual data** has rapidly expanded across various corporate sectors, including **communications, marketing, and finance**.  

For example, in **communications**, a recent survey (USC Annenberg Center for Public Relations, 2024) highlights that most professionals already use LLM-powered AI for **content generation** and increasingly rely on **NLP-based dialogical interfaces** for interacting with data. In **finance**, NLP enhances the use of textual data for **research and market intelligence**, contributing significantly to **FinTech innovations**.  

Thus, it is crucial for future professionals in **communication, marketing, finance, and business** to develop a solid understanding of **NLP technologies**â€”their **capabilities, limitations, and risks**.  

This course is particularly designed for **students of Financial Communication** but is open to a broader audience of business and finance students. It aims to equip **non-technical students** with the necessary knowledge to **critically assess** NLP tools and their outputs. Moreover, it provides **hands-on experience**, preparing students to work in **interdisciplinary teams** alongside **NLP experts and data scientists** to leverage these technologies effectively.
